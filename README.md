## Ad- hoc Insights -Music Store Analysis
## Project
The Online Music Store management had some questions that needed to be answered for their upcoming plans and take decisions backed-up by data.
They need a Data Analyst to examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering these questions.

## Database & Tools:
Postgre SQL
PgAdmin4

Things that I've learnt from this project:
Important SQL concepts like Subqueries, Multiple joins, CTE, Window functions, etc. to query the database.

This Project is a part of Rishabh Mishra's Data Analyst Portfolio Project.
